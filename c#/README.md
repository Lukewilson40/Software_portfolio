### Overview

As a software engineer, I am always striving to enhance my skills by exploring and implementing features in new programming languages. This project demonstrates my understanding of the C# language through the creation of a **Number Guessing Game**. The program challenges users to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range while providing feedback to refine their guesses.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of C# syntax and fundamental concepts, such as random number generation, conditional statements, loops, and event-driven programming. Additionally, it allowed me to explore graphical user interface development through Windows Forms, making the application more interactive and user-friendly.

### Development Environment

-   **Tools Used**:  
    I developed this program using Visual Studio 2022, a powerful IDE that provides a rich set of features for debugging, testing, and building C# applications.

-   **Programming Language**:  
    The project was written in C#, using the .NET Framework for GUI development with Windows Forms. No external libraries were required beyond the built-in framework.

### Future Work

-   **Implement Additional Difficulty Levels**:  
    Add more dynamic difficulty ranges that the user can select or customize.

-   **Improve the User Interface**:  
    Enhance the design of the Windows Forms GUI for a more polished look and feel.

-   **Add a Timer Feature**:  
    Introduce a timer to track how long it takes for a player to guess the correct number.

-   **Track High Scores**:  
    Implement a high-score feature that saves the best attempts locally or in a database.

-   **Multi-Language Support**:  
    Add language options to make the game accessible to a broader audience.
