# Overview

As a software engineer focused on building a solid foundation in C++ programming, I created a text-based adventure game titled "Echoes of Elyria". This project demonstrates various fundamental concepts of the C++ language, including control structures, object-oriented programming, and data management.

The game is designed around an exploration-driven narrative, where the player navigates through different locations, collects items, and solves puzzles. Key features include an inventory management system using vectors, a branching storyline with multiple outcomes, and functions to handle player actions, interactions, and game state. Each function in the game reflects modular design principles, enhancing readability and scalability. The project also leverages basic I/O operations to facilitate user interaction, laying the groundwork for more complex C++ applications.

Overall, this project provided a hands-on experience with C++ and allowed me to expand my understanding of software development fundamentals, which are crucial in my journey toward becoming a proficient C++ programmer.

I wrote this software to get more familiar with the C++ language
