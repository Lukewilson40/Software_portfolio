# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continuously working to improve my skills and explore new areas of development. This project is part of my effort to enhance my understanding of Python programming and game design by creating a simple "Choose Your Own Adventure" text-based game.

The software simulates an interactive story where the player takes on the role of a man who wakes up from a 30-year coma, believing he is 30 years in the future. The game presents various scenarios and choices, allowing the player to explore the hospital setting and uncover different outcomes based on their decisions.

The purpose of this software is to practice implementing branching storylines, managing player input, and designing a user-friendly text-based game loop. This project also helps me experiment with maintaining a cohesive narrative while adding replayability through multiple endings.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools and environment:

-   **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
-   **Programming Language**: Python 3.11
-   **Libraries**: No external libraries were required; the game is built entirely with Pythonâ€™s standard libraries.

# Useful Websites

Here are some resources that were helpful during the development of this project:

-   [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - For troubleshooting and exploring best practices in Python.
-   [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) - For tutorials on Python programming.

# Future Work

There are several features and improvements I plan to implement in future iterations of the game:

-   Add more branching storylines to increase the complexity and replayability of the game.
-   Include randomized events or scenarios to make each playthrough unique.
-   Implement a save/load system so players can continue their adventure later.
-   Refine the narrative to add more depth and emotional engagement.
-   Add ASCII art or simple graphics to enhance the visual experience of the game.
